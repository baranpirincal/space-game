# Mission One

Old-school space shooter. Tribute to Alien Outbreak.

## Description (dull stuff, don't read it)

I focused mainly on programming and graphics therefore story in game is simplified. You play as a Admiral of the spaceship and your mission is to destroy all enemy ships. You gain experience and new technologies through the gameplay. While you have to destroy hostiles, you must also watch out for their fire and deadly meteors.

Game is pretty short (20 waves of enemies) and it usually takes 15-25 minutes to finish it. I didn't want to bore players with same stuff.

Project was created in Unity.
